    <h2>Our Hour Of Code</h2>
    <p>We, the ADA students Melek Topchu, Ravan Abdinli, Emil Mirzazada, and Suel Heybatova, visited Baku Secondary School No. 42
      on November 14, 2022, at 9 a.m., in an effort to demystify "coding,"
      demonstrate that anyone can learn the fundamentals, and increase interest in the field of computer science.
      Communicating in Azerbaijani was a revelation in terms of both teaching and connecting
      with the language, as well as looking at the material we had studied ourselves
      from a new perspective. Staff and students from class 5"E" not only welcomed us warmly,
      but also effectively accomplished the assigned duties.</p>
